# Alarm Kata

Alarm Kata in Java.

## Difficulty

Easy. Good for teaching: Introducing tests, Mocking, Refactoring

## Problem Description

`Alarm` class is part of much bigger legacy system. Since there is been a 
lot of bugs in the past related to this code, your task is to introduce tests
to this part of system (`Alarm` class). 

## Stage 2 - Refactoring

Refactor `Alarm` class until you are satisfied with design. 
Keep in mind that `Alarm` class is used by other parts of legacy system
(that is not presented here), so try not to break contract by changing 
behavior or interface.
